/* The execution of the programming starts with the main() function.
 * The main() function can be used only once in a program.
 * The main function returns void.
 * Searches for main() and then it executes the code written inside it.
 * We can not use the value returned by void functions in dart.
 * Void return type is used here because it needs to run for one time only(at the time of execution) and it is also not required to return any value.
